            Scaling percentage. 100 means 100% scale, so no changes.
            LVGL scales UI with the DPI settings. This isn't a complete solution for high
            resolution tiny screens. This scaling parameter allows for compensating this somewhat.
            This value can also be used when creating widgets, but it isn't in use by the LVGL theme.
